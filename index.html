            <h3>Here's a timeline of Turing's life:</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London</li>
              <li><strong>1918</strong> - Joins St Michael’s day school in Hastings, where he does not do very well. He is sent  to  Hazelhurst Preparatory School where he learns to play chess.</li> 
               <li><strong>1926</strong> - Becomes a student at Sherbone School in D  orset. He is not interested in their traditional classical education as he really wants to spend his time st  udying Science and Mathematics.</li>
              <li><strong>1927</strong> - Becomes deeply interested in the work of Albe  rt Einstein and is able to develop work done by Einstein based on a questioning of Newton’s Laws of Motion</li> 
              <li><strong>1934</strong> - Graduates with distinction in Mathematics from King’s College, Cambridge</li>
              <li><strong>1938</strong> - Goes to Princeton University in America to study mathematics and is awarded a PhD</li>
              <li><strong>1939</strong> - Is asked to join the Government Codes and Ciphers School and arrives at Bletchley Park the day after war is declared</li>
               <li><strong>1940</strong> - With Gordon Welchman, he develops the Bombe to decipher the messages sent by the Germans using their Enigma machine.</li>
               <li><strong>1943</strong> - Works with top people in the USA, which he visits to share information on code breaking</li>
              <li><strong>1945</strong> - At the end of the war, he is awarded the OBE for his wartime services</li>
              <li><strong>1946</strong> - Publishes a paper with the first detailed design of a stored-program computer</li>
              <li><strong>1949</strong> - Is made deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University</li>
              <li><strong>1950</strong> - Publishes the famous paper ‘Computer Machinery and Intelligence’ in which he develops the Turing Test</li>
              <li><strong>1951</strong> - Is elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and also gives talks about Artificial Intelligence on BBC</li>
              <li><strong>1952</strong> - Arrested for gross indecency. He loses his security clearance so he cannot work. He is offered chemical treatment instead of going to prison. The treatment makes him very unwell.</li>
               <li><strong>1954</strong> - Found dead in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, from poisoning. A half-eaten apple was found next to him laced with cyanide.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
              <p>“This man was a national treasure and we hounded him to his death... I'm looking for an apology from the British government because that's where I think the wrong was done. But Turing is clearly someone of international stature.”</p>
